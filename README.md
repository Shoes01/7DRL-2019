__Dependencies__

You need Python 3.7.0, Numpy 1.16.1 and tcod 9.0.0 to player.

__How to play__

Use the numpad for movement. Spacebar interacts with items - equips items, consumes souls, takes stairs. The numpad 5 will confirm actions.
Once items are equipped, you will be able to use their skills, if any. The QWEASD keys allow you to do this.

__Core mechanic__

Your soul informs your stats. A soul with big numbers means you have big stats. 
Your job describes how these numbers are assigned to a stat. Even as the soul numbers are changed, your highest number will always be assigned to the same stat.
Your race confers a flat bonus to all stats.

As you kill enemies, some will have souls worthy of consumption. You will have a bit of control over how the souls are merged.

__Secondary mechanics__

_Speed_

If your SPD stat is five greater than your opponent, you will hit them twice. Depending on your job, you may need to keep an eye on your SPD stat. Too high, and the points are wasted.

_Skills_

Items grant powerful skills.
