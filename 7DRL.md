Soul number mechanic.

__Goal 2.1__
Stats are derived in unique way.

A Soul Number is a 2x3 matrix of numbers.
The class of a unit informs how the soul number is used to affect the stats.
A racial bonus is a flat number applied to all stats.
HP always has a multiplier on it.

Stats are:
ATK
DEF
MAG
RES
SPD
HP

> Example
Soul rank: "plain"
Soul Number: [  [0, 0, 1], 
                [1, 0, -2]]
Warrior: ATK // HP // DEF // SPD // RES // MAG
Race: Rat + 1

Total:
ATK: 2
HP : 2
DEF: 1
SPD: 1
RES: 1
MAG:-1

__Goal 2.2__
The play may consume the souls of the fallen to increase their own power.

The play may rotate or flip the soul before consuming it, thus choosing how it affects the numbers.

__Goal 3__
Skills are interesting.
Enemies use the skills too???

Gameplay has the player taking on huge numbers of lowly creatures, and a few heroic opponents.
