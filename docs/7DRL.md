[GOALS]

__Goal 1__
Controls are hyper-streamlined.

Controls:
    Numpad: movement
    num_5: wait, or interact with item
    qweads: activate skill

    esc: exit

    need a way to drop items. Space bar over nothing? not a bad idea! always swaps, even with nothing...

All other information is on the HUD.

<what about damage?> Killing enemies returns HP. Killing many per turn grants more HP? Revenge kills grant more HP? <lore> When a soul leaves a body, you absorb some of that ... energy ...

__Goal 1.1__
No inventory.

Picking up an item prompts the player to swap if one is already equipped.

###################

Pressing SPACE triggers the "interact" action.

If there is an item on the ground, equip it
    If there is already an item equipped in that slot, compare the items
        Press 9 for SWAP, 3 for DON'T SWAP

If there is nothing on the ground, pass turn.

>>> The ITEMDESC panel should say what "5" does. Rename to the INTERACTION panel.

__Goal 3__
Skills are interesting.
Enemies use the skills too???

Gameplay has the player taking on huge numbers of lowly creatures, and a few heroic opponents.
